# My-Portfolio-Website

## Project Overview

This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed and built from scratch to showcase my journey into data analytics, my technical skill set, and my analytical projects — all wrapped in an interactive and user-focused experience.

The website combines front-end development, data storytelling, and interactive features to reflect how I approach analytics: structured, curious, and impact-driven.

It is not a template. Every section, animation, and interaction was intentionally designed and implemented.

## Objectives

Create a professional online presence for recruiters and hiring managers

Communicate my transition from a BSc science background into data analytics

Showcase real data projects in a clear and accessible way

Demonstrate front-end engineering fundamentals alongside analytics skills

Add interactive elements to reflect curiosity, creativity, and technical range

## Tech Stack
Front-End

HTML5 – semantic, accessible structure

CSS3 – custom styling using a consistent gold/cream theme

Vanilla JavaScript – all interactions built without frameworks

Data & Interactive Features

Custom typewriter animation (no libraries)

Snake game built with JavaScript and CSS Grid

AI-powered data Q&A feature (API integration)

Scroll-based reveal animations

Dark mode toggle

## Key Features
1️⃣ About Me – Typewriter Narrative

A custom-built typewriter effect that:

Types the full “About Me” text once

Triggers only when the section enters view

Stops cleanly without restarting or looping

Designed to guide the reader through my career transition story naturally

2️⃣ Skills & Projects Showcase

Responsive grid layout for data projects

Each project links directly to GitHub repositories

Focus on SQL, Python, data modelling, and visualisation

Clean UI that prioritises clarity over clutter

3️⃣ Interactive Snake Game 🐍

Built entirely in JavaScript using:

CSS Grid for positioning

Keyboard controls (arrow keys start and play the game)

Features:

Score & high-score tracking

Collision detection

Game reset logic

Included intentionally to show:

Logical thinking

Event handling

State management

4️⃣ AI Data Question Generator 🤖

Users can ask data-related questions directly on the site

Integrated with an AI API to generate responses

Responses are animated with a typewriter effect

Styled to match the rest of the website (no visual disconnect)

Demonstrates:

API integration

Asynchronous JavaScript

UX-focused design

5️⃣ Dark Mode & UX Enhancements

One-click dark mode toggle

Smooth scrolling

Reveal-on-scroll animations

Mobile responsiveness across all sections


Each feature is modular and intentionally separated to keep the codebase readable, scalable, and easy to maintain. The final product is a polished, interactive, and recruiter-ready portfolio that:

Communicates technical capability clearly

Balances professionalism with personality

Demonstrates both data analytics thinking and front-end engineering

Reflects how I approach real-world problems: structured, curious, and user-focused

This project represents not just what I’ve learned, but how I think and build.


## Future Improvements

Deploy with a custom domain

Connect AI responses to portfolio project context

Add blog section for analytics case studies

Integrate analytics to track user interaction
